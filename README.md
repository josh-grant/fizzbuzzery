# fizzbuzzery
This repo is a  bunch of fizzbuzzes in a few different languages, which I will probably add to as I have a crack at new technologies and approaches to solving problems.

Current implementations on the repo are:

- C (C99) without runtime arguments for upper/lower limit (initial PoC)
- C (C99) with args
- Python (2.7.10) with args
- Java (SE8) with args
- JavaScript (NodeJS) with args

For those who aren't familiar with FizzBuzz/Fizzbuzz/etc, it's a quick test of a programmer's ability to apply their raw logical aptitude, without being able to rely on any particular library/tool/platform, and gives a good indicator of their actual inate ability to produce good code.

I like FizzBuzzing because no matter how great you think your implementation is, how much you refine it, and how concise your code is, there's always space to make it faster, cleaner, more elegant or idiomatic. I like to use it as a way to quickly gain a bit more familiarity with a programming language/style/paradigm in a way that is a little bit more tangible than just messing around with it, and a little more satisfying than printing out a sketchy "Hello World!".

Plus, as Jeff Atwood at CodingHorror.com said, it's good for sorting out which programmers "can't program their way out of a paper bag".
